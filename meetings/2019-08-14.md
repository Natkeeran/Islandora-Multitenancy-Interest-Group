# Agenda

* What are the problems that multi-tenancy solves? How do these map to Drupal/Islandora 8?
    * Related question: what are the use cases for multi-sites?
* What should be shared?
   * Fedora
   * Microservices
   * Content?
   * Other?
* Technical Hurdles:
     * Islandora configurations as Drupal variables
     * All configuration options should be surfaced as Drupal variables, instead of database-stored configurations


# Notes:

## What are the problems that multi-tenancy solves? 
* Parent site able to see/search/display the content from all children +[many]
* Multiple sites sharing objects as well
Categorizing content with urls/theming, etc via namespaces
* Manage child site objects from within the parent site +1 (if it’s possible)
* Shared Back-End
   * Shared Fedora +4  (Danny, Nat, David, Brad)
   * Shared Solr +2   (Danny, Nat)
   * Shared Triple Store
   * Maybe shared microservices?
* Deployment architecture
* “Namespaces” or ways to cleanly separate content between sites. Also important for Solr
* Managing embargoes between children and parent sites
* being able to identify the source repository for each object.
* Shared modules
* Islandora communicating ACL to lock down Fedora
* presenting ‘client’ sites as sites unto themselves
* Domains
* Themes
* Access


## How do these map to Drupal/Islandora 8?
* Noah has used namespaces/XACML to achieve the content syndication without multisites
* Key concepts: separation of content, federation of search, own sites, multi-tenant single Fedora

## Technical Hurdles:
* Islandora configurations as Drupal variables
* All configuration options should be surfaced as Drupal variables, instead of database-stored configurations
* Can we do the federation with Solr and leave the content where it is?
* No namespace support
* In 7, everything was in Fedora; in 8, it’s served from Drupal. 
* Everything is nodes - how to give a parent site access to all those database tables?
* Two kinds of multisites:
   * One database
   * Many databases
* Separation of content in the triplestore
* Changes needed in Milliner?
* Harvesters
        
## Next Steps:
* Another meeting at the end of the month using original Doodle results
* Multitenancy Interest Group
