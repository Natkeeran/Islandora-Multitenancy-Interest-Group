# Agenda

1. Discussion: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300
    * Outline of the plan
    * What's missing?
    * Next steps?
        * Official recommendation to all Islandora developers: configuration options should be surfaced as Drupal variables, instead of database-stored configurations, et al., to enable Drupal multi-site settings.php overrides (Brad)
        * Explore/prototype options for approaches to searching across multiple sites: multiple solr cores (proposed [idea](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300) at islandoracon), [feeds + search api approach](http://www.noreiko.com/blog/multi-site-search-using-feeds-and-searchapi), [federated search approach](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1227)
    * Relevant PRs:
