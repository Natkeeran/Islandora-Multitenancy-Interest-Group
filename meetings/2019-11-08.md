# Agenda

1. Discussion: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300
    * Outline of the plan
    * What's missing?
    * Next steps?
        * Official recommendation to all Islandora developers: configuration options should be surfaced as Drupal variables, instead of database-stored configurations, et al., to enable Drupal multi-site settings.php overrides (Brad)
        * Explore/prototype options for approaches to searching across multiple sites: multiple solr cores (proposed [idea](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300) at islandoracon), [feeds + search api approach](http://www.noreiko.com/blog/multi-site-search-using-feeds-and-searchapi), [federated search approach](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1227)
    * Relevant PRs:

# Meeting Minutes

1. Discussion: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300
   * Outline of the plan
   * No current questions about the [cookbook](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300).
   
2. What's missing?
   * Questions regarding Jared’s comments on the cookbook.
   * Milliner is the piece that calls out to the library that will allow communication with the Fedora API; you need it to know what your Fedora root is for a particular things you can make the correct call to put it in the right place.
   * Nat is doing some dev work on this and has some interest, so hopefully he can work with Jared to get changes committed.
   * Relevant PRs: https://github.com/Islandora/Alpaca/pull/65
      * Next set of PRs to be incorporated into Islandora 8.1 would allow you to say in your settings file what your Fedora root is and would listen to that through the chain of creating your item in Fedora.
      * Explore/prototype options for approaches to searching across multiple sites: multiple solr cores (proposed [idea](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1300) at islandoracon), [feeds + search api approach](http://www.noreiko.com/blog/multi-site-search-using-feeds-and-searchapi), [federated search approach](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1227).
      * Eli will set up a test case once changes are merged/committed for the group to review so we can see if it works the way we think it’ll work.
   * Solr plan outlined in the cookbook is a configuration effort and would likely work outside the box, but the con is that you end up with duplicating your Solr core. Not duplicating nodes, but you have everything indexed in two cores. There are also particulars you’d need to consider regarding permissions.
      * Duplicating within the Solr core(s) is still better than duplicating objects. More likely an issue with larger parent/child sites than smaller repository setups.
   * Permissions are still not in place in the way we need them. If we need to write policies to say a root in Fedora is writable by a set of people, and another group is writable from another set of people, it needs to be passed through Drupal permissions which are still not mapped to WebAC policies.
      * Advocate in the Islandora 8 tech calls to discuss this in detail, mostly regarding reading of items, not so much writing of items.
   * Federated search: Searches multiple Drupal sites.
   * RSS feeds search API approach. 1 Islandora site could be a harvester and provider (?).
   * Islandora 8 by default has minimal Solr indexing happening and needs to be configured, so if you tell it to index certain fields it will.
   * Prototype: 
      * Use multiple Fedora roots: 2 child sites and 1 aggregator/parent site using the multiple Solr core indexing approach.
      * Solr search configured to display thumbnail, link to object, title, date, description.
      * Propose that Islandora defaults include Solr configuration that indexes these fields.
      * Permissions will not be included in this since they don’t currently exist as needed.
      
3. Next steps?
      * Brad officially recommends to all Islandora developers: configuration options should be surfaced as Drupal variables, instead of database-stored configurations, et al., to enable Drupal multi-site settings.php to override for things like faceting searches so they can be established per site.
      * Engage Diego regarding Solr questions et al. if he’s willing to chime in.
